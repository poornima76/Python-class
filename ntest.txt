comment: But if you don't have the interest to work on something (particular) any more, do you really want techniques or whatever to push through anyway?I suppose it depends what the goal is - the question being asked suggests to me you want a successful side project (or even full time business?) no matter what it is, the tech it uses, etc. If that's the case, then I can't speak to motivation, but you need to pick a project based on identifying a niche, product market fit, etc., not experimenting with what's hot and sparking your interest this week.If that's not right, then I think the question's wrong, and maybe you just need to come to terms with it being ok to experiment with things, prototype things; that they don't have to turn into an MVP that anyone else ever sees, you're just having fun/learning about things.And even if it's a bit of both, you want the successful business, just only if you love the tech or idea, then you're still doing nothing wrong, because all these so far have not panned out in the loving it sense before they had a chance to pan out or not in the business success sense (so that's inconsequential).comment: The last 20% of any project is where 80% of the work lies. At the beginning it's fun and frenetic, you can write tons of code and feel like you've made big progress. The last 20% is integrations, debugging, sometimes painful bits you had deferred to later.What you need is discipline, not motivation. Motivation is fleeting, while important, it always runs out. Work on making a schedule and sticking to it as a goal unto itself. Make a contract with your future self and do it.On a note on small things that have really helped me - don't tell anyone about your project till it is finished. I find talking about your half finished projects gives a similar sort of dopamine hit to finishing and can rob you of the gratification which would drive you to finish.comment: Yeah I think balancing is importanr. You don't want to die at 60, the first day of your retirement, after living 100% ascetically your entire life. It would be too risky of an investment. I think something 20/80 (20 spending) is roughly a good idea.comment: Maybe you just need a friend with business acumen.I also must have 100s of projects that I started, built a bit, then abandoned when I got bored. But for some of them, friends and/or acquaintances later asked me to finish it for them (or their company). Staying motivated is much easier if you have a team rooting for you and excitedly asking for updates. Also, it feels fantastic to see your hobby project turn into a real product.comment: My solution to subclinical ADHD is to embark on a project of such ridiculous ambition and scope that it's never going to be finished anyway, where it's possible to work on different sub-projects within the larger project and still move forward.Don't listen to people who tell you to keep your ambitions small. Small is boring.comment: If you put yourself on a pedestal don't be surprised if you get knocked off of it.The response from @GSR6669 resonates with me:> Wikipedia suspended edits & changed the definition of recession at request of the US Government. Everyone likes to poke holes in Elon’s Twitter yet no choice is infallible.> Throwing rocks in a glass house is what makes you a real hypocrite though.comment: OpenAI did give free access to gpt-4 to Khan Academy [0] and i think some other non-profits.[0] https://blog.khanacademy.org/harnessing-ai-so-that-all-stude...comment: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35898372comment: The bigger reason this reply thread will be dominated by elon musk fans is that its about elon musk and elon musk fans vs elon musk haters is the divide that gets you the biggest blue vs non-blue ratio.comment: I never look at the name of the user posting a comment, just at the comment's content. Do people really remember names here? Just such as mine?)comment: Details are wrong, but the general point is: given design decisions in Wikipedia having article take specific form is a matter of making correct person/people make it so, meaning it is something one can buy (with some extra steps of buying access to those people yada yada, nowhere near limits of state actors powers).comment: I am aware of that, that's why I mentioned it could be an ALSA plugin.From https://github.com/chadmed/asahi-audio> ASoC exposes the speaker array as six independent drivers - two woofers and a tweeter each for Left and Right. We want userspace to see this as a standard stereo speaker pair. The configuration fragment shipped in this package sets up a virtual sink that takes a stereo input and routes it appropriately to each driver.> We then run into another issue - the speakers sound awful. Turns out Macs aren't magic, they sound good because Apple invest a lot of engineering effort into DSP. Apple actually handle this with odd bespoke Core Audio plugins. We use PipeWire's convolver plugin to apply impulse responses to each driver, which effectively EQs the output signals.> The kernel driver currently makes no effort to diminish your ability to destroy your machine through misconfigured settings in userspaceThis is what I find quite unacceptable from a design PoV, this kind of safety should be as close to the kernel as possible.comment: broken on Firefox mobile. Mirror: https://archive.is/0bxwRcomment: There is a strong element of truth in that, but I don't think its the whole truth.While carefully airbrushed from public discourse the very function of capitalism is absolutely predicated on the legitimacy and protection granted by the collective. Every time an "important sector" gets bailed out you have a direct confirmation of our deep inter-dependencies. Privatizing profit and socializing loss is proof of the deep prevailing immorality of the "system". Yet there is nothing that says that all those financial inventions must degenerate into obsessive profit-seeking.Capitalism is a broad set of contractual arrangements, information flows, monetary accounting and the like, that facilitate economic function. Almost everything in this toolkit is configurable (via legislation and regulation, but even more so by widely adopted moral behavior) to the most minute detail. You could have for-profit employee owned corporations for example (they do exist and they work just fine).Blaming "generic" capitalist tools is similar to blaming digital tech as such. Both are manifestations of "social tech" but what you do with them depends on your moral sandbox. You can legitimately blame php for its limitations as a technology. But you can use php to write mediawiki or to write facebook. You can piggy-bag on PageRank or LLM to sell targeted ads or opt to empower every person alive with new and powerful information processing tools.I think people adopt non-profit status to immunize against a metastasized environment where anything but the most rapacious behavior is dead on arrival. But it really does not have to be this way and it wasn't always that way (in space and time). In a sense it is an extreme measure which realistically and unfortunately (in the short term at least) cannot become the norm. We really ought to fix capitalism. Even if our digital sphere was a benign utopia, we face horrendous environmental sustainability problems that the current version of capitalism has absolutely no idea how to fix. Hopefully there will be a well researched and objective Wikipedia article on how to do this :-)comment: It's quite hard to take this comment in good faith, because the politics of wikipedia community of power editors is well documented and criticised. But since you've decided that out of all the comments in this thread, that my one somehow demands more robust empirical scrutiny, here's an empirical study for your reference [0].> I really don't understand either how editing a wikipedia article gives you power over someoneIt is impossible for me to take this comment at face value. I don't believe that it is not immediately obvious to you how exerting editorial control over the 7th most visited site on the internet, a site that is aiming to represent "the sum of all human knowledge", represents a significant source of power to influence society.It's great that you've enjoyed the process of contributing minor edits, and content to niche fields. But you can't ignore the fact that a majority of the content comes from a tiny minority of the userbase, and that their motives demonstrably resolve around a desire to control information in many cases.[0]: https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:4228b090-8900-4a29-baa3-66...> Based on empirical data drawn from a series of interviews and an exhaustive analysis of its cases between 2004 and 2020, this paper examines the ways in which the Arbitration Committee handles conduct-related disputes between editors, and the impact of social capital, summarily defined as the “capital captured through social relations” (Lin 2001, 19), on this process. My empirical material indicates that the Arbitration Committee not only examines the merits of the claims made by the disputants, but also and more crucially facilitates a social contest by considering the position of each disputant within the community of editors. Ultimately, the Arbitration Committee seeks to “cancel” these disputes in order to preserve Wikipedia’s social fabric.comment: > it still should be 0.85 seconds per nodeNo it's not, because I will not architecture my whole pipeline & program around Julia inability to start in a second, I will just use another language.comment: I find it a pretty powerful motivator for working on it _in general_. I mean, I'd love to work for Wikipedia. It feels like I'm participating in something to make the world a better place, as opposed to most of the for profit companies that get the hype these days.comment: It's quite much possibly my (previous) bubble.> The language of science remains English.While I agree with you, born and raised  in the Eastern block, they also had their common blanket statements. Looking from the other side, they turned out to be wrong.I'll keep an open mind, in case I'm again on some other sides.comment: The meaning of life is to love everyone.You first need to love yourself, then you can grow to love - and nurture - everyone you can.comment: Is it, though? Wayland has solved a bunch of problems that I had become used to under Xorg to the point of not noticing anymore, and even though I bumped into new issues on Wayland at first (and tbh there are still few open out there), going back to Xorg nowadays feels like going backwards.comment: > I'd like there to be at least one comment here calling out Wikipedia without praising Musk.I'll add another one; the way anything related to the origins of Covid-19 was handled was disgraceful. Yes, the way Facebook et al handled it was just as disgraceful, but the idea of Wikipedia is that they're above that.comment: > it seem about 5% of all registration forms use a regex similar to .*@[a-z0-9]\.[a-z]{2,4}That matches @0.ab, but not mail@example.com.I think you mean: .+@[a-z0-9]+\.[a-z]{2,4}comment: Maybe it's not a problem to let your brain wonder without constraints deadlines and stress. Let it be creative. You can do this and still release something once in a while.comment: External accountability can help with this. It's one reason why building something small helps - you can get it in the hands of users more quickly. Then they want this or that and it gets you motivated.Of course, it's hard to build something at any scale that people WANT to use. So you might find accountability to start some other way. One thing to try is to solve a problem for ONE person and make it your mission to make them happy. Maybe your mom has a problem that you could fix, or a friend. Maybe it's simple, like needing a new way of listing to-dos or groceries. But find a problem for one person and tell them you're doing it. That can help you find the motivation to finish.comment: You’re probably over-planning.Scale back and just plan for a release in 2-4 weeks. Ignore everything else outside of what you can get done in that time frame. Drop the consideration of things like the domain and the name. Fight the urge to play with fancy scaffolding that eats productivity. Once you’ve launched, you’ll have a foundation to iterate on.Release early, release often.comment: The point is rather that a notable chunk of the the worlds most valuable websites are nonprofits. Despite them receiving considerably less investment than their for profit / venture capital counterparts.comment: If you have a company that is ideologically against paying dividends or doing stock buybacks and instead buys gold with its profits, its value would still go up as if it did stock buybacks because share owners also own a fraction of the gold. Now imagine a real business like Amazon reinvesting, the investments raise the value of the company's assets.comment: "because people who pay for Twitter have their replies shown first"I don't really go to Twitter, so I don't know, but am curious: Is this an established fact? A quick search did not show anything official confirming this.comment: They must have never experienced Xorg crashing. Neither have I. That speaks for Xorg.It has been over a decade and I keep finding myself disabling Wayland still. That said, Linux is not my primary driver, I just can not be bothered.comment: Could it be that people care even less about your useless inflammatory opinions, which is why they would rather never see them again?
